# Nondeterminism, Subset Construction and Epsilon Moves

## Determinism

- **Determinism** - next state uniquely determined by current state and input
- **Nondeterminism** - given a current state and input, there can be any number of next states (could be 0)

## Nondeterministic Finite Automata

We have states and transitions as before, but: 

- There are **two** b-labelled transitions from 0
- There are **no** transitions from 1.

### Formal Definition

**NFA** $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Delta, s, F):$

- $Q​$  is a finite set of States

- $\Sigma$ is an alphabet

- > $\Delta : Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow 2^Q$ (*subsets of Q - think power set*) is the **transition function**
  >
  > - We will write $q \xrightarrow{\sigma}  q'$ for $q' \in \Delta(q, \sigma) $ 

- $s$ is the start state

- $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of final states

For nondeterministic automata the transition function is redefined while the other properties remain the same.

### Picture ⇔ Formal Presentation

|                     | a        | b          |
| :------------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| **$\rightarrow$ 0** | $\{0\}$  | $\{0, 1\}$ |
| **1F**              | $\empty$ | $\empty$   |

$Q = \{0, 1\}, \Sigma = \{a, b\}$

$s=0, F=\{1\}$

$\Delta(0, a) = \{0\}, \Delta(0, b) = \{0, 1\}$

$\Delta(1, a) = \empty, \Delta(1, b) = \empty$

*We use brackets for NFAs as now the combinations are sets*

### Nondeterministic Acceptance

- In the same way as a deterministic automata it accepts somes strings and rejects the others.
- *Diagrammatically*: place a pebble on the initial state, move it by choosing a transition according to the symbols in the string. Accept there is a way of choosing transitions in such a way that we end in a final state, otherwise reject.
  - **Accept**: $abbab, babbbab$
  - **Reject**: $\epsilon, abba$ 

For $\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \in \Sigma$ write $q \xrightarrow{\sigma_1\sigma_2} q'$ when there is a $q''$ such that $q \xrightarrow{\sigma_1} q''$ and $q'' \xrightarrow{\sigma_2} q'$and similarly for longer strings. This just means when we feed the machine $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ we end up in state $q'$

We can also say $q \xrightarrow\epsilon q'$ then $q = q'$ as feeding an empty string will trigger no transition and so $q'$ must be the **same state**.

A string $x \in \Sigma^*$ determines a (possibly empty) set of states $q$ such that $s \xrightarrow{x} q$ (a word $x$ applied when the machine is in a state $s$ ends up in a state in $q$). 

> $M$ **accepts** $x$ when there exists $f \in F$ such that $s \xrightarrow{x} f$ 

## DFAs and NFAs

Any DFA is a special kind of NFA meaning you can create a DFA that will accept the same strings but it may require more states. The conversion process is known as **subset construction**.

In terms of **power** they are also equivalent which can be proven by:

- Composing $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ with the *singleton* function $\eta : Q \rightarrow 2^Q$ defined $\eta(q) = \{q\}$ to obtain a function $\delta ; \eta : Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow 2^Q$

## Subset Construction

> The purpose of this automata is the same as the original example. To accept any word that **ends in a b**.

Let $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Delta, s, F)$ be an NFA

We can construct a DFA $M'$ over $\Sigma​$ with:

- Set of states $Q' = 2^Q$ 		*The POWER SET of the states*
- Starting state $s' = \{s\}$
- End state $F' = \{X | \exists f \in F . f \in X\}$      *One of the final states of the NFA belongs to the set* 
- Transition function $\delta'(X, \sigma) = \cup_{q \in X} \Delta(q, \sigma)$

Here we can see the conversion from NFA to DFA. The automata on the top right is the same as our original example however we know have **four states**.

The states corresponding to subsets $\empty$ and $\{1\}$ are called **unreachable** as there is **no path from the start state** that ends in such a state.

Some people call $\empty$ the error state. 

> The set notation state names can be thought of as "you could be in either of these states" in the example above if you read a **b** from the start state you could either be in state 0 or 1 in the NFA and hence move to the state {0, 1} in the DFA

### Conclusions

This means any DFA is an NFA so **regular languages** are included in the class of languages accepted by NFAs.

We can use NFAs to prove a language is regular.

Any NFA can also be turned into a DFA that accepts the same language so:

> NFAs accept precisely the **regular languages**

## Epsilon Moves

 Nondeterminism can be tamed (converted to DFA) but the trade off is a potentially exponential increase in the number of states.

> The idea is you can always take an **$\epsilon$-labelled** transition **without consuming a symbol**

**$\epsilon$NFA** $M = (Q, \Sigma, \theta, s, F):$

- $Q$  is a finite set of States

- $\Sigma$ is an alphabet

- > $\theta : Q \times (\Sigma + \{\epsilon\}) \rightarrow 2^Q$ is the **new** transition function
  >
  > - We will write $q \xrightarrow{\sigma}  q'$ for $q' \in \theta(q, \sigma) $ 

- $s$ is the start state

- $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of final states

### Acceptance in $\epsilon$NFAs

$q \overset{\epsilon}{\Rightarrow} q'$ if either q = q' or there exists a sequence of $\epsilon$-moves $q \xrightarrow{\epsilon} ... \xrightarrow{\epsilon}q' $ 

$q \overset{\sigma}{\Rightarrow} q'$ (for $\sigma \in \Sigma$) if there exists a sequence $q \overset{\epsilon}{\Rightarrow} \xrightarrow{\sigma} \overset{\epsilon}{\Rightarrow} q'$

$q \overset{\sigma \tau}{\Rightarrow} q'$ if we have $q \overset{\epsilon}{\Rightarrow}  \xrightarrow{\sigma} \overset{\epsilon}{\Rightarrow} \xrightarrow{\tau} \overset{\epsilon}{\Rightarrow} q'$ and similarly for *longer strings* 

A string $x$ is accepted if there exists $f \in F$ such that $s \overset{x}{\Rightarrow} f$

###  $\epsilon$NFAs to NFAs 

Any NFA is a special kind of $\epsilon$NFA (one that has no $\epsilon$ transitions)

Let $M$ be an $\epsilon$NFA. Let $M'$ be an NFA with the **same states** but:

- $\Delta ' (q, \sigma) = \{q' | q  \overset{\epsilon}{\Rightarrow}  \xrightarrow{\sigma} q'\}$
- $F' = \{q | \space \exists f \in F . q \overset{\epsilon}{\Rightarrow} f\}$

![Screenshot 2018-10-05 at 15.31.27](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 1/Images/Epsilon NFAs to NFAs.png)

We can therefore claim that $L(M) = L(M')$

We can also use $\epsilon$-moves to prove the union of two regular languages is also regular by connecting the two machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ to a start state by an $\epsilon$ transition.

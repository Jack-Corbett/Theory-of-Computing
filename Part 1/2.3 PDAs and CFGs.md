# PDAs and CFGs

### Pushdown Automata

- Finite automata with an unbounded stack
- Can construct one to accept $\{a^nb^n | n \geq 0\}$
- Accept by final state or empty stack

### Context Free Grammars

- Nonterminals, terminals, derivations
- Can come up with one to derive $\{a^nb^n | n \geq 0\}$
- Can put one in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) or Greibach Normal Form (GNF) (losing $\epsilon​$)

### Conversion

1. Grammar in GNF to a PDA
2. One state PDA to a grammar
3. PDA to a one state PDA

Using the data:
$$
CFG \rightarrow GNF \rightarrow PDA \\
and\\
PDA \rightarrow one \ state \ PDA \rightarrow CFG
$$

> This also means PDAs and CFGs have the same **power**

## CFG to PDA

We can convert CFG's to PDA's: 

Suppose that $G = (N, Σ, P, S)$ is a CFG. We will construct a PDA $M$ such that $L(M) = L(G)$

- Assume that $G$ is in Greibach normal form
  - All production rules are in the form $A \rightarrow \sigma B_1...B_k$
- The PDA will have only **one state** $*$ and will accept by empty stack
  - $x$ will be accepted when there exists a computation $(*, x, \bot) \implies (*, \epsilon, \epsilon)$

### The Construction

Let $G = (N, \Sigma, P, S)$ the required PDA is $(\{*\}, \Sigma, N, \delta, *, S, \empty)$

- $*$ is the only state
- $N$ the set of **nonterminals** of $G$, is the stack alphabet
- S the start production, is the initial stack symbol
- We accept by empty stack, so no need for final states
- $\delta$ is consructed as:
  - For each $A \rightarrow \sigma B_1...B_k$ in $P, ((*, \sigma, A), (*, B_1...B_k)) \in \delta$

### Example

Consider the grammar
$$
S \rightarrow aSB \ | \ aB, \quad B \rightarrow b
$$
The corresponding PDA has one state, initial stack symbol $S$ and the following productions

**Leftmost** derivation $\overset{def}{=}$ productions are applied only to the leftmost nonterminal

Leftmost derivations of a grammar in **GNF** = accepting runs in the corresponding **PDA**

## PDA with one state to CFG

The constuction above is reversible...

Suppose we have a PDA $(\{q\}, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q, \bot, \empty)$ 

Let $G = (\Gamma, \Sigma, P, \bot)$

$P$ is constructed as follows:

- For each $((q, c, A), (q, B_1...B_k)) \in \delta$ 
  - Let $A \rightarrow cB_1...B_k$ be in $P$

> Because of the correspondence (leftmost dreivations) $\Longleftrightarrow$ (computations), the language defined by the grammar and the pushdown automaton coincide

## PDA to PDA with one state

*Idea*: All state info is maintained on the **stack**

Transform a PDA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, s, \bot, F)$ to a PDA $M'$ with a single final state $t$ so that $M'$ can clear its stack after getting to $t$ 

![Screenshot 2018-11-01 at 19.43.16](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 1/Images/PDA to one state PDA.png)

> Clearly $L(M) = L(M')$ and $M'$ can clear its stack once in $t$ 

We can assume that the PDA has one accept state $t$ and can clear its stack once it reaches the final state
$$
M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, s, \bot, \{t\})
$$
Let $\Gamma' \overset{def}{=} Q \times \Gamma \times Q$ so a symbol in $\Gamma'$ is a triple $(p, A, q)$ where $p, q \in Q$ and $A \in \Gamma$

We will write $\langle pAq \rangle$ to denote such an element of $\Gamma'$ 



Let $M' \overset{def}{=} (\{*\}, \Sigma, \Gamma', \delta', *, \langle s \bot t \rangle, \empty)$ where $\delta'$ is defined as follows:

- For each transition $((p, \sigma, A), (q_0, B_1B_2...B_k)) \in \delta$ include:

$$
((*, \sigma, \langle pAq_k \rangle), (*, \langle q_0B_1q_1 \rangle \langle q_1B_2q_2 \rangle ... \langle q_{k-1}B_kq_k \rangle)) \quad \text{in } \delta'  \text{for all possible choices of } q_1, q_2,...,q_k \in Q
$$

> **Note** when **k = 0** this reduces to: for each transition $((p, \sigma, A), (q_0, \epsilon)) \in \delta$ include $((*, \sigma, \langle pAq_0 \rangle ), (*, \epsilon))$ in $\delta'$

*Idea*: At each stage, we nondeterministically guess the remainder of the computation of $M$ and then verify it

### Example

Consider the PDA: $\{\{0, 1, 2\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, \bot\}, \delta, 0, \bot, \{2\}\}$

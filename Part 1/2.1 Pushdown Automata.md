# Pushdown Automata

A finite automata can be thought of as a machine that scans a string (*think turing machine*) 

A string $x$ is accepted if there exists a computation that ends in a final state

The **control unit** has access to a stack which has no pre-set size limit - **unbounded memory**

It takes transitions based on the element $\sigma$ read and the element $\gamma$ on the top of the stack

## Formally

A **PDA** is a 7-tuple $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, s, \bot, F)$

- $Q$ is a finite set of states

- > $\Sigma$ is the **input** alphabet

- >  $\Gamma$ is the **stack** alphabet

- > $\delta$ is the transition relation

- $s \in Q$ is the start state

- > $\bot \in \Gamma$ is the **initial** stack symbol (bottom of the stack)

- $F \subseteq Q$  is the set of final states

## Transitions

For example:
$$
((q, \sigma, \gamma), (q', \gamma_1\gamma_2 ... \gamma_k)) \in \delta
$$
If in state $q$, reading $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ on top of the stack, then pop $\gamma$ off the stack and go to state $q'$ pushing $\gamma_1\gamma_2..\gamma_k$ on the stack ($\gamma_k$ first, $\gamma_1$ last)

> **Diagram**: If you read $\sigma$, pop $\gamma$ off the stack and push $\gamma_1\gamma_2..\gamma_k$

## Configuration

A complete description of a computation at a point in time:

- The **current state**
- The **part of input still to be read**
- The **contents of the stack**

It is an element of $Q \times \Sigma^* \times \Gamma^*$ 

eg: $(q, \sigma_1...\sigma_k, \gamma_1...\gamma_l \bot) $

## Semantics

We define a relation $\rightarrow$ between configurations:

Let $s \in \Sigma^*$ and $g, h \in \Gamma^*$ write:

- $(q, \sigma s, \gamma g) \rightarrow (q', s, hg)$ when $((q, \sigma, \gamma), (q', h)) \in \delta$
- $(q, s, \gamma g) \rightarrow (q', s, hg)$ when $((q, \epsilon, \gamma), (q', h)) \in \delta$

> $\rightarrow$ is nondeterministic (*see $\delta$ definition above*) 

## Acceptance

Given configurations $C_1, C_2$ write $C_1 \implies C_2$  if there exist configurations $C'_1, ... , C'_k$  for some $k \in N$ such that: 
$$
C_1 \rightarrow C'_1 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow C'_k \rightarrow C_2
$$
$x \in \Sigma^*$ is accepted by $M$ if there exists $f \in F$ such that:
$$
(s, x, \bot) \implies (f, \epsilon, g)
$$

> **Note** all of the input has to be consumed

### Language Accepted by a PA

> Suppose $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, s, \bot, F)$ is a PA
>
> â€‹	$L(M) = \{x \space | \space \exists f \in F. (s, x, \bot) \implies (f, \epsilon, g)\}$

##  Example

- PA that accepts the language $\{a^nb^n \space | \space n \geq 1\}$  
- Let $\Sigma \overset{def}{=} \{a,b\}, \Gamma \overset{def}{=} \{a, \bot\}, Q \overset{def}{=} \{0, 1, 2\}$ with 0 the initial state and 2 the final state

$\delta$ contains the following pairs:

1. $((0, a, \bot), (0, a\bot))$
2. $((0, a, a), (0, aa))$
3. $((0, b, a), (1, \epsilon)$ 
4. $((1, b, a), (1, \epsilon))$
5. $((1, \epsilon, \bot), (2, \epsilon))$

#### Simulation

## Languages Accepted

- All regular languages

> Any $\epsilon$NFA can be considered as a PA that doesn't use its stack

- Palindromes
- Balanced parentheses

### Acceptance by Empty Stack

**Normally** we accept a string $x$ when there exists $f \in F$ such that
$$
(s, x, \bot) \implies (f, \epsilon, g)
$$
 This is **acceptance by final state**



However for PAs $M$ also accepts $x$ if there exists some $q \in Q$ such that
$$
(s, x, \bot) \implies (q, \epsilon, \epsilon)
$$
This is **acceptance by empty stack**

## Final State vs Empty Stack

The two notions of PA can simulate each other:

- Any PA $M$ that accepts by final state can be altered to a PA $M'$ that accepts by empty stack
- Any PA $M$ that accepts by empty stack can be altered to a PA $M'$ that accepts by final state

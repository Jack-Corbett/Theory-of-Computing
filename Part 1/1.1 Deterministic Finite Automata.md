#Deterministic Finite Automata and Regular Languages

## Alphabet and String

* An alphabet $\Sigma$ is any **finite set** of symbols
  * $\{0, 1\}$ a binary alphabet
  * $\{a, b\}$ is a letter alphabet
* A string $s$ over $\Sigma$ is a **finite seqence** of elements of $\Sigma$
* The length $ \# $ of a string is its number of elements
* The **empty string** is $\epsilon$ is a string
  * where $\#(\epsilon)=0$

## Properties of string

Strings $s, t$ over $\Sigma$ are equal precisely when they have the *same* elements in the *same* order

$\Sigma $*  = The *set of all strings* over $\Sigma$ 

$\Sigma$* is infite because you can always add more, provided it is not an empty alphabet (must be at least uniary)

$\Sigma$* is all of the words you can create using the alphabet

Every string is either:
- Empty $(\epsilon)$ 
- $x\sigma$ where $\sigma \in \Sigma$ 

'Length' is a function $\# : \Sigma$*$ \rightarrow N$  where $N$ is the set of the natural numbers.

> We can define it recursively as: $\#(\epsilon) = 0,    \#(x\sigma) = \#(x) + 1$

## Concatenation

Given alphabet $\Sigma$, the **set of all strings over $\Sigma$** is $\Sigma$*

Given strings $s, t \in \Sigma$*, their **concatenation** is $st$
* Any string t statisfies the property that $\epsilon t = t\epsilon = t$
  * If you attach an empty string to a string it is still that string (kinda intuitive)

* Simply take 2 strings and attach them together
* $\Sigma$* together with concatenation  is called the **free monoid** on $\Sigma$

## Languages

**A language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is some set of string in $\Sigma$* **

* Let $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}​$ 
* Then $L1  = \{ 1 \} $ $L2 = \{10^k | k \geq 0\},   L3 = \Sigma$* are all langauges
* Two languages are equal if they contain the same strings

## Finite Automata

**State** - a description of a system at some point in time

Use mathematical models of *systems with a finite number of states* called **finite automata**

Finite automata can be:
* Deterministic
* Nondeterministic
* Nondeterministic with $\epsilon$-moves

## Deterministic Finite Automata

* The picture is of a DFA over $\{a, b\}$ with two states, 0 and 1
* 0 is the **start state**
* 1 is the **final state**
* The labelled arrows represent transitions
* It will only accept words that end in $b$

### Formal Definition

**DFA** $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F):$

-  $Q$  is a finite set of States
- $\Sigma$ is an alphabet
- $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ is the **transition function**
- $s$ is the start state
-  $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of final states

###Picture ⇔ formal presentation

|                     | a    | b    |
| :------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| **$\rightarrow$ 0** | 0    | 1    |
| **1F**              | 0    | 1    |

$Q = \{0, 1\}, \Sigma = \{a, b\}$

$s=0, F=\{1\}$

$\delta(0, a) = 0, \space \delta(0, b) = 1$

$\delta(1, a) = 0, \space \delta(1, b) = 1$

### Deterministic Acceptance

An automoton accepts some strings (and rejects those that it doesn't accept)

*Diagrammatically*:

- Start on the inital state
- Move it according to the symbols in the string
- Accept if at the end you are on the final state
- Otherwise reject it

They act just like a finite state machine

For $\sigma _1, \sigma _2 \in \Sigma$ write $q \xrightarrow{\sigma_1\sigma_2} q'$ when there exists a $q''$ such that $q \xrightarrow{\sigma1} q''$ and $q'' \xrightarrow{\sigma2} q'$

For longer strings when $ q = q'$  then $q \xrightarrow{\epsilon} q'$

##Regular Languages

**Definition** for DFA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F), L(M)$ is the language of all accepted strings, 

​	$L(M) = \{ x \in \Sigma^* \exists f \in F . s x\rightarrow f \}$ 

> **Definition** a language is regular when it is $L(M)$ for some DFA $M$

*  ∅ and $\Sigma $* are regular
*  If $L$ is regular then the complement $\Sigma^* - L$ (sometimes written as ~$L$) $ = \{x \in \Sigma^* | x \notin L \}$
   *  In order to construct this automata we keep everything the same as before but make all the final states (members of $F$) non final and all the non final states final. **Formally** $F' = Q - F$

##Products of Automata

The product construction is useful for providing some of the properties

Intuition: if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are DFA then $M_1$ X $M_2$ is the DFA that simulates the running of $M_1$and $M_2$ in **parallel**

Formally:
* Given $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, s_1, F_1)$ and $M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, s_2, F_2)$
* Let $M_3$ be defined: 
  * $Q_3 = Q_1 \times Q_2$
  * $\delta_3((q_1, q_2), \sigma) = (\delta_1(q_1, \sigma), \delta_2(q_2, \sigma))$
  * $s_3 = (s_1, s_2)$
  * $F_3 = F_1 \times F_2$

If we define $M_3$ in this way for a string to be accepted it must be accepted by **both** machines

If we were unioning $M_1$ and $M_2$ we would instead define F as: 

$F = (F_1 \times Q_2) \cup (Q_1 \times F_2)$

This means that for a string to be accepted it can be accepted in **either** machine

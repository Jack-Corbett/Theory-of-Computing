# Regular Expressions and Kleene's Theory

## Regular Expression

Given $\Sigma $, the set of r**egular expressions** is defined ***inductively***

### Base Cases

- Every $\sigma \in \Sigma$ is a regular exp
  - $L(\sigma) \overset{def}{=} \{\sigma\}$
- $\epsilon$ is a regular exp
  - $L(\epsilon) \overset{def}{=} \{\epsilon\}$
- $\empty​$  Is a regular exp
  - $L(\empty) \overset{def}{=} \empty$

### Operations

- If $\alpha, \beta$ are reg exp then $\alpha + \beta$ is a reg exp
  - $L(\alpha + \beta) \overset{def}{=} L(\alpha) \cup L(\beta)$

> Some people write $\alpha  \space | \space \beta$ but that is the same as addition (think OR)

- If $\alpha, \beta$ are reg exp then $\alpha\beta$ is a reg exp
  - $L(\alpha\beta) \overset{def}{=} L(\alpha) L(\beta)$

- If $\alpha$ is a reg exp then $\alpha^\ast$ is a reg exp
  - $L(\alpha^*) \overset{def}{=} L(\alpha^*)$

### Example

We can say that a string s **matches** a regular expresion $\alpha$ whenever $s \in L(\alpha) $

- No strings match $\empty$ since $L(\empty) = \empty$ 
- Strings that end in b match $(a+b)^*b$

$$
L((a + b)^*b) = L((a + b*)) L(b) = L(a + b)^*L(b)\\
= (L(a) \cup L(b))^*\{b\} = \{a,b\}^*\{b\}\\
= \{x_1...x_ny \space | \space n \in N, x_i \in \{a,b\} \space y \in \{b\}\}
$$

- Strings of even length match $((a+b)(a+b))^*$
- $abba$ and the empty string match $abba + \epsilon$

## Kleene's Theorem

> If $\alpha$ is a regular expression then $L(\alpha)$ is a regular language
>
> If L is a regular language then $ L = L(\alpha)$ for some regular expression $\alpha$

Basically **finite automata and regex** describe the **same languages** 

### Proof Concept

We know that DFAs, NFAs and $\epsilon$NFAs accept precisely the regular languages

To prove Kleene's Theorem:

1. Show how to convert a regular expression into an $\epsilon$NFA
2. Show how to convert any NFA to a regular expression

## Regular Expression to Finite Automata

The set of regex is built inductively

- $\sigma \in \Sigma, \epsilon$ and $\empty$ are the base cases
- +, $^.$ and * are the operations

So to prove that **$\forall\alpha. L(\alpha)$ is regular** we need to prove

- $L(\sigma), L(\epsilon)$ and $L(\empty)$ are regular
- If $L(\alpha), L(\beta)$ are regular then so is $L(\alpha+\beta)$
- If $L(\alpha), L(\beta)$ are regular then so is $L(\alpha\beta)$
- If $L(\alpha)$ is regular then so is $L(\alpha^\ast)$

### Proof

#### Base Cases

- $L(\sigma)$ is regular

- $L(\epsilon)$ is regular 

![Screenshot 2018-10-10 at 17.22.07](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 1/Images/L(epsilon) is regular.png)

- $L(\empty)$ is regular
  - *Start state with no final state*

#### Plus

Want to show that $L(\alpha + \beta) \overset{def}{=} L(\alpha) \cup L(\beta)$ is regular

- We can assume L(α) and L(β) are regular
- We’ve proved that regular languages are closed under union by having two $\epsilon$ moves to the start of $M_1$ and $M_2$ from the start state 
  - Hence L(α + β) is regular

#### Concatenation

Want to show that $L(\alpha\beta) \overset{def}{=} L(\alpha)L(\beta)$ is regular

- We can assume L(α) and L(β) are regular
- Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be NFAs for L(α) and L(β) respectively. 

We construct a new $\epsilon$NFA M~3~:

- As final states of M~3~ take those of M~2~. It is easy to show that

>  $L(M_3) = L(M_1)L(M_2) = L(\alpha)L(\beta)​$

#### Kleene star

Want to show that $L(α^∗)​$ is regular

- We can assume $L(\alpha)​$ is regular
- Let $M$ be an NFA for L(α) 

We construct a new $\epsilon$NFA $M′$

![Screenshot 2018-10-10 at 17.33.08](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 1/Images/Kleene Star.png)

As final states of $M′$ take the singleton $\{0\}$. It is easy to show that:

> $L(M′) = L(M)^∗ = L(α)^∗ = L(α^∗)$

## Finite Automata to Regular Expression

Let $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Delta, s, F)$ be an NFA. We first define a regular expression $\alpha_{u,v}^{X}$ for any $X \subseteq Q$ and $u, v \in Q$ 

> $\alpha_{u,v}^{X}$ is a regular expression that describes all possible paths from $u$ to $v$  that start with $u$, end with $v$ and have all the **intermediate states** in $X$
>

### Formal Definition

For $X \subseteq Q​$ let $q \xrightarrow{\sigma}_X q'​$ be shorthand for $\delta(q, \sigma) = q'​$ 

We extend the $\rightarrow_X​$ notation to arbitrary strings:
$$
q \xrightarrow{\epsilon}_X q' \overset{def}{=} q = q'\\
q \xrightarrow{x\epsilon}_X q' \overset{def}{=} \exists q'' \in X . q \xrightarrow{x}_X q'' \& \space q'' \xrightarrow{\sigma}_X q'
$$
 So $q \xrightarrow{x} q'$ is the same as $q \xrightarrow{x}_Q q'$

> The idea is we want $L(\alpha_{u,v}^{X}) = \{x \ | \ u \xrightarrow{x}_X v\}$

### Defining $\alpha_{u, v}^\empty$ 

Base case of $X = \empty​$

Let $a_1, ..., a_k​$ be all the symbols such that $\delta(u, a_i) = v​$ for $1 \leq i \leq k​$  
$$
u \neq v :	\alpha_{uv}^\empty \overset{def}{=} \{\overset{a_1 + ... + a_k \text{ if } k>0}{{_\empty} _{\text{ otherwise }}} \\
u = v :		\alpha_{uv}^\empty \overset{def}{=} \{\overset{a_1 + ... + a_k + \epsilon \text{ if } k>0}{{_\empty} _{\text{ otherwise }}}
$$
Inductive step: we know that $\alpha_{u, v}^X​$ 

How can we define $\alpha_{u, v}^{X+\{q\}}$ ?

### Inductive step

> Idea: a path from u to v in X + \{q\} goes through q k-times for some k

![Screenshot 2018-10-11 at 10.33.27](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 1/Images/Inductive Step.png)

- $\alpha_{u, v}^X$ - paths that **DON'T** go through q
- $\alpha_{u, q}^X \alpha_{q, u}^X$ - paths that go through q **ONCE**
- $\alpha_{u, q}^X \alpha_{q, q}^X \alpha_{q, u}^X$ - paths that go through q **TWICE**

### Definition of $\alpha_{u,v}^{X+\{q\}}$

$$
\alpha_{u,v}^{X+\{q\}} \overset{def}{=} \alpha_{u,v}^{X} + \alpha_{u,q}^{X}(\alpha_{q,q}^{X})^*\alpha_{q,v}^{X}
$$

### NFA to regex 

- Suppose $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F)​$ is a DFA
  - $L(M) = \{x | \widehat{\delta}(x) \in F \} = \{ x | \exists f \in F.s \xrightarrow{x} _Q f \}$
- $f_1, ..., f_k​$ Be all the states in F then the regex of L(M) is:
  - $\alpha_{s, f_1}^Q + \alpha_{s, f_2}^Q + ... + \alpha_{s, f_k}^Q$ 
- The construction of NFAs work the same

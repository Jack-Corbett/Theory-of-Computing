# Limitations of Regular Languages

**Regular Languages** are the class of languages accepted by a family (DFA, NFA, $\epsilon$NFA) of finite automata and matched by regular expressions.

However not all languages are regular... Using a counting argument, there are countably ($∼ N$) many regular expressions but, in general, uncountably ($∼ 2N$) many languages.

## A Non-regular Language

$$
\{a^n b^n\space|\space n \in N\}
$$

Any DFA has *finitely* many states. To accept $a^{1000}b^{1000}$ and reject $a^{1000}b^{999}$ it has to be able to count the number of $a$'s and **remember** how many have been seen when it passes the centre point to compare with the number of $b$'s. Only accepting if the number is the same.

Since the number is unbounded (it would have to do it for arbitrarily long strings giving infinitely many cases), there is no way to do this with a **finite number** of **states**. 

This is because all it "knows" at that point is represented in the state $q$ it is in, which is only a finite amount of information.

### Formal Proof

- Suppose that $M$ is an automaton that accepts $\{a^nb^n | n \in N\}$. 
- Suppose that $M$ has $k$ states. 
- Let $n > k$      *so there are more repetitions of a and b than the number of states*
- Consider the action of M on input $a^nb^n$ where $n \gg k$ 
- By the pigeonhole principal there must be some state $q$ that the automaton enters more than once while scanning the initial sequence of $a$'s 
- Therefore if we split the $a$'s into three pieces $u, v, w$ where $v$ is the string of $a$'s scanned between two occurances of state $q$, $v$ could be deleted and the resulting string would be erroneously accepted

This means $M$ also accepts $a^{n-l}b^n$ which is a **contradiction**

​	*As the number of a's is stricktly less than the number of b's*

We could also insert **extra copies** of $v$ and this would also be erroneously accepted 

## Pumping Lemma

> Pumping Lemma encapsulates the arguments above and can be used to prove a language is regular or the it's negation can be used to prove a language is **not** regular

$(A \space regular) \implies PL$ 		&		$\neg PL \implies (A \space not \space regular)$ 

The idea is that whenever an automaton scans a long string (*longer than the number of states*) and accepts, there must be a **repeated state**, and **extra copies** of the segment of the input between the two occurrences of that state can be **inserted** (*pumped*) and the resulting string is still accepted

### Splitting the String

Suppose that A is regular. There exists $k \in N$ such that for all strings $x, y, z$ with $xyz \in A$ and $\#y \geq k$ 

There exist strings $u, v, w$ with:

- $y = uvw$ and $v \neq \epsilon$
- $xuv^iwz \in A$ for all $i \geq 0$ 

We use $i$ to pump $v$ as many times as we like and because $v$ starts and ends in the same state our new string will still be in $A$

### The Demon Game

It is often used in it's contrapositive form, we can think of this as a game between you and a demon. Given the defintions above the game proceeds as follows:

1. **Demon** picks some $k > 0 $
2. **We** pick $x, y, z$ such that $xyz \in A$ and $\#y \geq k$
3. **Demon** picks $u, v, w$ such that $y = uvw$ and $v \neq \epsilon$
4. **We** pick $i \geq 0$     *Make sure we define what i is...* $uv^iw$

> **We** win if $xuv^iwz \notin A$ 
>
> **Demon** wins if $xuv^iwz \in A$ 	*ie we pick a word that is in the language* 

If we have a winning strategy (no matter what the demon does, we can always win) then we have shown that A is **not regular**

## Examples

### Basic Example

$$
A = \{a^nb^n \space | \space n \in N\}
$$

1. **Demon** picks some $k > 0 $
2. **We** pick $x = a^k$, $y = b^k$, $z = \epsilon$ 
3. **Demon** picks $u, v, w$ such that $y = uvw$ and $v \neq \epsilon$ 
   - Because of our choice of $y, v = b^l$ for some $0 < l \leq k$ 
   - Then $u = b^r$ and $w = b^s$ for some $r, s \geq 0$ with $k = r + l + s$ (since $y = b^k = b^r b^l b^s$). In particular $r + s = k - l$ 

4. **We** pick $i = 0$ 
   - Then $xuv^0wz = a^kb^rb^s \epsilon = a^kb^{r+s} = a^kb^{k-l}$ 
   - We **win** because $a^kb^{k-l} \notin A$ 

> This is a winning strategy, because we have made no assumption on what the demon does. Whatever the demon does, we end up winning. Thus **$A$ is not regular**. 

### Palindrome Example

*A palingdrome is a string that reads the same from left to right and right to left*

If we assume that $P$ is regular then $P \space \cap \space L(a^*ba^*)$ is regular since regular languages are closed under intersection
$$
P \space \cap \space L(a^*ba^*) = \{a^nba^n | n \in N\}
$$
  We can now play the demon game:

1. **Demon** picks some $k > 0$
2. **We** pick $x = \epsilon, y = a^k, z = ba^k$
3. **Demon** divides $y$ into $uvw$ with $v$ non-empty. Hence $v = a^l$ for some $0 < l \leq k$
4. **We** pick $i = 0​$, clearly $a^{k-l}ba^k​$ is not in the language 

> The above is a winning strategy and thus **$A$ is not regular** 

### Past Paper Example

We pick $a^{(k+3)!}$ or $a^{(k+10)!}$ arbtrarily. As we can't pick $a^{(k+1)!}$ as if $k=1$ then $k! = 1$ which would mean $x = a^{(k+1)! - k}$ would be empty and $y=a^k$ would only have one symbol in it. Meaning we couldn't beat the demon as no matter how we pumped it would be in the language.

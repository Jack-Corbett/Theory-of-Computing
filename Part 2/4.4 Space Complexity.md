# Space Complexity

The space complexity of a decider is the function $f : \N \rightarrow \N$ where $f(n)$ is the maximum number of **tape cells** the machine scans on any branch of its computation, on any input of length $n$ 

> Assume $f(n) \geq n$. If a decider runs in $f(n)$ space, then it runs in $2^{O(f(n))}$ time

This means the time complexity is 2 to the power of O(space complexity)

## Example - SAT

We believe we cannot solve SAT with polynomial **time** but it be done in polynomial **space**

On input $\phi$, with $\phi$ a boolean formula in variables $x_1,...,x_n$ 

1. For each assignment to the variables $x_1,...,x_n$  
   - Evaluate $\phi$ on that assignement
2. If $\phi$ ever evaluates to 1 then accept, otherwise reject once all assignments are explored.

This runs in polynomial space as it can **reuse space**:

- Only the current truth assignement needs to be stored, and this can be done with $O(n)$ space
- Evaluating the expression can be done with $O(m)$ space, where $m$ is the size of the expression

##  PSPACE and NPSPACE

**PSPACE** - The set of all decision problems that can be solved by a **deterministic** Turing machine using polynomial space

**NPSPACE** - The set of all decision problems that can be solved by a **non-deterministic** Turing machine using polynomial space

Similarly to the class P and NP:

## Savitch's Theorem

**Recall**: Every $t(n)$ time non-deterministic Turing machine has an equivalent $2^{O(t(n))}$ time deterministic Turing machine.

However it changes when it comes to space:

> For $f(n) \geq n$, every $f(n)$ space non-deterministic Turing machine has an equivalent $f(n)^2$ space deterministic Turing machine
>
> So... PSPACE = NPSPACE 

## EXPTIME

The set of all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in time $O(2^{n^k})$ for some $k \in \N$ 

## Relationships

- P $\sube$ PSPACE: a machine that runs in polynomial time can only use polynomial space
- NP $\sube$ NPSPACE: *same reasoning* 

> Hence, by Savitch's theorem: NP $\sube$ PSPACE

- PSPACE $\sube$ EXPTIME
  - If a decider runs in $f(n)$ space, then it runs in $2^{O(f(n))}$ time

We don't know which of these inclusions are strict... All we know is P is a strict subset of EXPTIME

Written out together the relationships are:
$$
P \sube NP \sube \text{PSPACE} = \text{NPSPACE} \sube EXPTIME \\
P \sub EXPTIME
$$

## PSPACE-Completeness

A decision problem X is PSPACE-complete if

- X is in PSPACE
- Every problem A in PSPACE is polynomial-time reducible to X

If X only satisfies the second condition, it is called **PSPACE-hard**
$$
\text{PSPACE-complete} = \text{PSPACE-hard} \cap PSPACE
$$

> *Why not polynomial space reducible?*
>
> We defined NP-complete problems by using polynomial-time reductions because we wanted the reduction to be **easy** compared to typical problems in NP... If we used polynomial **space** reduction then an easy solution for the problem we are reducing to would not necessarily give an **easy** solution to the problem we are reducing from.

### Example

Let TQBF be the problem of deciding whether a fully quantified boolean formula is true. TQBF is in PSPACE.

# Rice's Theorem

> **Definition:** every nontrivial property of recursively enumerable sets is undecidable

- A property of r.e. sets is just a map $P : \{\text{r.e. subsets of } \Sigma^*\} \rightarrow \{t , f\}$. For any r.e. set $X \sube \Sigma^*$, either $P(X) = t$ or $P(X) = f$ 
- A property is **non-trivial** when it is not universally $t$ or universally $f​$ 

> So what Rice’s theorem means is that if you partition the set of all r.e sets into two using some condition, both partitions will be undecidable.

If we split based onthe property that the set contains the empty string both the resultant sets are no longer recursively enumerable as it's impossible to tell if a TM accepts the empty string. As we have previously shown a reduction from HP to this.

It's not just the empty string...

## Example Properties

A r.e. set is described using a TM that accepts it:

- $\{M \ | \ L(M) = \empty\} \quad (P(L)) \overset{def}{=} (L = \empty)$
- $\{M \ | \ \epsilon \in L(M)\} \quad (P(L) \overset{def}{=} (\epsilon \in L))$
- $\{M \ | \ L(M) \text{ is finite}\} \quad (P(L) \overset{def}{=} (L \text{ is finite}))$
- $\{M \ | \ L(M) \ \text{ is regular}\}$
- $\{M \ | \ L(M) \ \text{ is context-free}\}$
- $\{M \ | \ L(M) = \Sigma^*\}$

By Rice's therem, each of these sets/properties is (**not** recursive)/**undecidable**

## Non Properties

The following are properties of **TMs**, but **not of r.e. sets** as in each case one can give two TMs that accept the same set, one which satisfies the property and the other which doesn't:

- $\{M \ | \ M \text{ has at least 400 states }\}$
  - We can find two Turing machines accepting the same language (r.e. set), one with at least 400 states and one with less than 400 states	

- $\{M \ | \ M \text{ halts on all inputs }\}$
  - We can find two Turing machines accepting the same languages (r.e. set), one which always halts and one which does not

## Decidable Problems Concerning Languages

- **Membership** problem for DFAs/NFAs: does a given DFA/NFA accept a given string?
  - Can be decided by simulating the DFA on the given string. For NFAs, first translate to an equivalent DFA, then simulate.
- **Emptiness** problem for DFAs/NFAs: does a given DFA/NFA accept *any* strings at all?
  - Can be decided using a Turing machine/algorithm which successively marks states reachable form the initial state. When no more states can be marked, it checks whether the final state has been marked.
- **Equivalence** problems for DFAs: given two DFAs, do they accept the same language?
  - Yes: test emptiness of DFA for *symmetric difference* of $L(A)$ and $L(B)$: $(L(A) /\ L(B)) \ \cup \ (L(B) /\ L(A))$



- **Membership** problem for CFGs
  - In general, cannot try all possible derivations as there may be infinitely many of them. So first translate to Chomsky normal form, then try all possible derivations consisting of $2n - 1$ steps for a word length $n$ (there are only finitely many of them!)
- **Emptiness** problem for CFGs
  - Idea: Use marking algorithm to check, for each variable, if it can generate any string of terminals

## Conclusions

Once a computational mechanism has enough power, (TMs, untyped λ-calculus, C programs, Java programs, etc.) many (most?) reasonable questions become undecidable

Not only can we not write a “smart” C interpreter that will tell us if C programs halt, we cannot ever write an interpreter that will tell us if a C program will halt on a specific input

## Polynomial Time Reduction

If we can reduce one problem A to another problem B, then any polynomial time algorithm for B will give us a polynomial time algorithm for A, won’t it?

It depends on how fast the reduction can be computed. If the translation algorithm runs in exponential time, the above is clearly not true. We will therefore introduce the concept of polynomial time reduction.

> **Polynomial Time Computable Functions**: A function $f : \Sigma^* \rightarrow \Delta^*$ is polynomial time computable if there exists a polynomial time deterministic Turing machine that halts on each input $w \in \Sigma^*$ with just $f(w)$ on its tape.

Let **A** and **B** be two decision problems:

> A **polynomial time reduction** from A to B is a function f which maps instances of A to instances of B, such that:
>
> - F is computable in polynomial time;
> - For any instance x of A, x is a “yes” instance of A if and only if f(x) is a “yes” instance of B.
>
> We write $A ≤_P B$ if a polynomial time reduction from A to B​ exists.

Given an instance x of A, compute f(x) and run the algorithm for B on it. This will tell us whether x is a "yes" instance of A. The time taken to do all of this is polynomial.

## Reduction of Graph Colouring (3COL) to Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)

3COL and SAT are both problems we don't have a polynomial time algorithm for. This reduction shows that if we can find a polynomial time algorithm for SAT we can find one for 3COL.

> Given a graph G, find a transformation of G to a boolean expression, such that the expression is satisfiable precisely when the graph is 3-colourable. The transformation must be computable in **polynomial time**.

An assignment of 0's and 1's to the boolean variables must correspond to an assignement of colours to the vertices

So each vertex $v_1,...,v_m$ of $G$, we have three boolean variables, for a total of 3m variables:

- $r_i$ : 1 precisely when $v_i$ is RED
- $g_i$ : 1 precisely when $v_i$ is GREEN
- $b_i$ : 1 precisely when $v_i$ is BLUE

The logical relationships between the boolean variables must correspond to the colouring constraints on the graph:

1. For each vertex $v_i$, the expression $(r_i \or g_i \or b_i)$ must be true - *each vertex has at least one colour*
2. For each vertex $v_i$, the expression $\neg(r_i \and g_i)\and\neg(r_i\and b_i)\and\neg(g_i\and b_i)$ must be true - *each vertex has at most one colour* 
3. For each edge $e_{i,j}$, which is present in $G$, we need constraints $\neg(r_i \and r_j)\and\neg(g_i\and g_j)\and\neg(b_i\and b_j)$ - *adjacent vertices cannot have the same colour*

We combine these formulae together into another boolean expression $f(G)$ by anding them all togehter.

The expression $f(G)$ is satisfiable precisely when there exists an assignment of exactly one colour to each graph vertex, such that adjacent vertices have different colours.

The number of characters in the output expression $f(G)$ equals:
$$
7m + 20m + 20l + (2m + l - 1)
$$
Where $m$ = no of vertices and $l$ = no of edges

This is polynomial in the size of the input and one pass through the input suffices to compute $f$. So $f$ can be computed in polynomial time.

As we have found a polynomial time reduction of 3COL to SAT if we can find a polynomial time algorithm for one then we can also for the other. Conversley if we prove we can't find a polynomial algorithm for one we can't find one for the other.

## Hard Problems

The idea is that if we can reduce all NP problems to a problem in polynomial time, then that problem must be “**hard**”, because a polynomial time algorithm for it leads to polynomial time algorithms for all NP problems.

## The Cook-Levin Theorem

Says that every problem in NP can be **reduced** to SAT, so SAT is at least as hard as any NP problem.

This means if we can find a polynomial time algorithm for SAT, then we can find one for **any** NP problem ie P=NP

### Importance

If we ever find a polynomial time algorithm for SAT we will know one for every NP problem including 3COL and TSP

On the other hand, probably P is not equal to NP. In this case SAT can not be in P.

## NP-Hard and NP-Complete

> A decision problem X is called **NP-hard** if every decision problem $Y$ in NP is polynomial time reducible to $X$.
>
> If $X$ is also in NP, it is called **NP-complete**.

Cook and Levin were the first to show that there exists an NP-complete problem - SAT

To prove that another problem (X) is NP-complete, we only have to show it is in NP and then find a polynomial time redution to this problem from SAT

Then there must be a polynomial time reduction from any NP problem to X (via SAT)

If X is an NP-complete problem and there exists a polynomial time reduction from X to some problem Y, then Y is NP-hard. Using this we can find lots of NP-complete problems...

The bigger picture looks like this:

## Thought Experiments

> Suppose we have a problem X which is $O(n^2)$, and a polynomial time reduction of 3COL to X. What can we deduce? 

X must be in P. But, the polynomial time reduction of 3COL to X tells us that X is NP-hard. Since X is in P, which is in NP, X is also NP-complete, and so P = NP.

Alternatively, we can see that the reduction gives us a polynomial time algorithm for 3COL, and therefore for any NP problem.

> Suppose we have an NP problem X and an algorithm for X which is $Θ(2^n)$. What can we deduce?

Not much. There could be a faster (polynomial) algorithm for X; all we know is that X is $O(2^n)$.

If we knew that X itself was $Θ(2^n)$, then there could be no algorithm for $X$ faster than $Θ(2^n)$, so no polynomial algorithm for X. This would prove $P \neq NP​$.

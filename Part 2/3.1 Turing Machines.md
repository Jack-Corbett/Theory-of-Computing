# Turing Machines

Invented by Alan Turing in 1936 before the first electronic computers

It is one formalisation of a 'fully powerful' machine:

- Regular/context free languages can be accepted by severely limited machines
- Turing machines are as powerful as computer programming can be - sometimes it is said that C and Java are **turing-powerful** languages

To give a TM is one abstract way of saying what it means to give an '**algorithm**'

TMs have self-reference, we will talk about the **Universal TM** (UTM) - a TM that acts as an interpreter for TMs

> Not all languages can be accepted by Turing Machines

## Definition

### Informally

- Start in the start state $s \in Q$ at the leftmost position on the tape
- In each step the TM is in some state $q$ and at tape position with $\gamma$. Depending on $q$ and $\gamma$ it will:

1. Write a new symbol at the current tape position
2. Move left or right once cell
3. Change state

-  A TM *accepts* by reaching a special **accept state** $t \in Q$, *rejects* by entering a special **reject state** $r \in Q$

### Formally

$M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, ⊢, \sqcup, \delta, s, t, r)$

- $Q$ is a finite set of states
- $\Sigma​$ is the input alphabet 

> The input alphabet is a subset of the tape alphabet but they cannot be the same as the tape alphabet needs the blank space and end marker

- $\Gamma​$ is the **tape** alphabet ($\Sigma \sube \Gamma​$)
- $⊢ \in \Gamma - \Sigma​$ is the **left endmarker**
- $\sqcup \in \Gamma - \Sigma$ is the **blank symbol**
- $\delta : (Q - \{t,r\}) \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}$ is the **transition function**
- $s \in Q$ is the **start state**
- $t \in Q$ is the **accept state**
- $r \in Q$ is the **reject state** $r \neq t$

#### Transition Function

$$
\delta : (Q - \{t,r\}) \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}
$$

$\delta (q, \gamma) = (q', \gamma ', X)$  means: when in a state $q$ scanning symbol $\gamma$, write symbol $\gamma' $ on the tape, move the head in direction $X$ and enter state $q′$

> **Restriction**: Cannot overwrite the left endmarker ⊢, cannot move to the left of the first symbol on the tape

We also require that once the machine enters its accept state or reject state, it never leaves it.

## Configurations

We can characterise a point in a computation using:

- Current state $q$
- Contents of the tape - Some $y \in \Gamma^*$ (the non-blank part of the tape $y\sqcup\sqcup...$)
- Position of the **head** - A natural number (0 for $⊢$)

> A triple $(q,y,n)$ is called a **configuration**

The initial configuration is $(s, ⊢x, 0)$ where $x \in \Sigma^*$ is the input

## Semantics

For a string $y = y_0 ... y_k$ by convention we let $y_n = \sqcup$ for $n > k$ 

Then for any $n \in \N$ let $\overline{y_n} = y_0 ... y_{n-1}$ and $\underline{y_n} = y_{n+1} ... y_k$ we can define the transition relation:

- Now for all configurations $\eta$ let $\eta \xrightarrow{0} \eta$, and recursively let $\eta \xrightarrow{n+1} \mu$ when there exists $\theta$ such that $\eta \xrightarrow{n} \theta$ and $\theta \xrightarrow{1} \mu$
- These transition relations are **deterministic** - for any $n$ if $\eta \xrightarrow{n} \theta$ and $\theta \xrightarrow{n} \theta'$ then $\theta = \theta'$
- Write $\eta \implies \theta$ if there exists some $n$ such that $\eta \xrightarrow{n} \theta$     (you can get to $\theta$ by taking a number of transitions)

## Accepting, Rejecting and Looping

$(t,y,n)$ is an **accepting configuration**

$(r,y,n)$ is a **rejecting configuration**

> Accepting and rejecting configurations are two possible kinds of **halting configurations**
>
> Once a halting configuration is reached the TM stops

- $M$ **accepts** an input $x$ when $(s,⊢x,0) \implies \eta$ for some accepting configuration $\eta$
- $M$ **rejects** an input $x$ when $(s,⊢x,0) \implies \theta$ for some rejecting configuration $\theta$ 

If $M$ neither accepts nor rejects then it **loops**

## Example

$$
\{a^nb^nc^n \ | \ n \geq 0 \}
$$

1. Scan the string from left to right, checking whether the string is in the form $a^*b^*c^*$, replacing the first empty space $\sqcup$ with a right endmarker symbol $⊣$
2. Scan from right to left, replacing the first $c$ with $\sqcup$, the first $b$ with $\sqcup$ and the first $a$ with $\sqcup​$ 
3. When we reach $⊢$ we can from left to right replacing the first $a$ with $\sqcup$, the first $b$ with $\sqcup$ and the first c with $\sqcup$ 
4. We repeat 2 and 3 until
   - We see some letter but not all three $\rightarrow$ we **reject**
   - We scan the whole string seeing only $\sqcup$'s $\rightarrow$ we **accept**

# Decidability and Universal Turing Machines

## Recursive & Recursively Enumerable Sets

Write $L(M)$ for the set of strings accepted by $M$

A set of strings (a language) is called **recursively enumerable** when there is some TM $M$ that accepts it.



A TM that halts on all inputs is called **total**    (*no infinite loops regardless of input*)

A set/language is called **recursive** when there is some **total** TM M that accepts it.



The set ${ a^nb^nc^n | n ≥ 0 }$ is recursive (*see example in 3.1*)

## Properties vs Languages

Suppose $P$ is a porperty of strings - ie for any $x \in \Sigma^*$ either $P(x)$ or $\neg P(x)$ 	eg : *has length 2*

$P$ is **decidable** $\overset{def}{=} \{x \in \Sigma^* | P(x)\}$ is recursive

$P$ is **semidecidable** $\overset{def}{=} \{x \in \Sigma^* | P(x)\}$ is recursively enumerable

> Notions decidable/recursive & semidecidable/recursive enumerable are equivalent
>
> - A is recursive $\iff x ∈ A$ is decidable
> - A is recursively enumerable $\iff x \in A$ is semidecidable

## Recursive Sets

Accepted by **total** Turing Machines

> Recursive sets are closed under complement

**Proof** suppose that $A$ is accepted by $M$. Then to accept $\Sigma^∗ − A$ it suffices to construct $M′$ that is like $M$ but with *swapped* accept and reject states.

> If $L$ is recursively enumerable and not recursive, $\neg L$ is not recursively enumerable

**Proof** if a TM $M_1$ accepts $L$ and $L$ is recursively enumerable and not recursive then $M_1$ loops on some strings that are not in $L$ (in $\neg L$). This means we can never construct a TM $M_2$ that accepts $\neg L$ as it would have to loop on some strings making $\neg L$ not recursively enumerable.

### Example Set

$\{ww \ |  \ w \in \{a,b\}^*\}$ is a recursive set as we can give a total TM for it which works as follows:

On input $x$, it scans out to the first blank symbol $\sqcup$, counting the number of symbols *mod 2* to make sure $x$ is of even length and rejecting immediately if not.

It lays down a right endmarker $⊣$, then repeatedly scans back and forth over the input. In each pass from right to left, it marks the first unmarked $a$ or $b$ it sees with '. In each pass from left to right, it marks the first unmarked $a$ or $b$ it sees with `. It continues this until all symbols are marked.

When they are all marked we have found the centre of the input string.

It then scans left to right and in each pass erases the first symbol it sees marked with ' but remembers that symbol until it finds the first symbol marked with `. It checks they are the same and erases it (by writting a $\sqcup$). If the two symbols are not the same it rejects, otherwise when all the symbols have been removed it accepts.

## Recursively Enumerable Sets

Accepted by (ordinary) Turing Machines - they can **loop** on some inputs

> **NOT** in general closed under complement - If both $A$ and $\neg A$ are recursively enumerable then $A$ is recursive

**Proof** suppose that the TM $M_1$ accepts $L$ and $M_2$ accepts $\neg L$ if we can construct a total TM $N$ that simulates both $M_1$ and $M_2$ we cab show this lemma is true...

- $M_1$ accepts everything in $L$, so it never hangs for strings in $L$
- $M_2$ accepts everything in $\neg L$, so it never hangs for strings that are **not** in $L$
- If $N$ simulates $M_1$ and $M_2$, that means if $M_1$ accepts, $N$ accepts, and if $M_2$ accepts, $N$ also accepts
- But $M_1$ never hangs for $L$, and $M_2$ never hangs for anything not in $L$. If $N$ will accept either $M_1$ or $M_2$, that means $N$ will never hang for $L$ and never hang for anything **not** in $L$. But that just means $N$ will accept any string!

Therefore $N$ won’t hang on **any** string, making it **recursive**.

We can construct $N$ as below...

## Simulation

Suppose that $M$ is a TM for $A$ and $M′$ is a TM for $¬A = Σ^∗ − A$. Construct a total TM $N$ that **simulates** running $M$ and $M′$ **simultaneously**.

For all $\gamma \in \Gamma$ and $\delta \in \Gamma', N$ has the following tape symbols:

![Screenshot 2018-11-14 at 14.02.02](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/Simulation.png)

**Idea**: Each cell represents two cells - one of $M$ and one of $M'$ - 'hats' mark positions of heads

**Simulation**: If the input is $x_1...x_k$, $N$ first rewrites the non-empty portion of tape as follows:

![Screenshot 2018-11-14 at 14.10.55](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/Simulation 2.png)

$N$ then performs the following loop:

1. Scans the tape to find a symbol with a hat in the 'upper' section of the tape. Then, according to the transitions of $M$ it performs $M$'s move
2. If $M$ accepts then $N$ accepts
3. Scans the tape to find a symbol with a hat in the 'lower' section of the tape. Then, according to the transitions of $M'$, it performs $M'$'s move
4. If $M'$ accepts then $N$ rejects

Any $x$ is either in $A$ or $\Sigma^* - A$. So it is accepted by either $M$ or $M'$

So $N$ will eventually accept or reject... Thus $N$ is **total** and so $A$ must be **recursive**

## Multiple Tapes

We can define a TM with multiple tapes

![Screenshot 2018-11-15 at 09.08.58](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory%20of%20Computing/Part%202/Images/Multiple%20Tapes.png)

- Input on the first tape, other tapes initially blank
- Tansition function has type $\delta : Q \times \Gamma^3 \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma^3 \times \{L,R\}^3$

> They are **no** more powerful than ordinary one-tape turing machines. This is because we could construct a one tape TM to simulate a multi-tape TM

## Universal Turing Machines

There exists a TM $U$ such that
$$
L(U) = \{M \ \#x \ | \ x \in L(M)\}
$$

> We can think of a UTM as an interpreter as it is a **Turing machine that can simulate other Turing machines** 
>
> ie: A program that takes in program + input and simulates the expected computation

$M\#x$ means: Encoding of $M$ followed by a seperator $\#$ followed by encoding of string $x$ in $M$'s input alphabet

$U$ will work as follows:

- Check whether $M$ and $x$ are correct encodings, reject if not
- Simulate $M$ on $x$ 
- Accept if $M$ accepts, reject if $M$ rejects

## Encoding Turing Machines

If we fix an encoding over the alphabet $\{0,1\}$ we have:
$$
0^n10^m10^k10^s10^t10^r10^u10^v 1
$$

This decodes to: states $\{0,1,...n-1\}$ tape alphabet $\{0,1,...,m-1\}$ of which first $k$ numbers is the input alphabet

The start, accept and reject states are $s$, $t$ and $r$. The blank symbol is $u$ and the endmarker is $v$.

The remainder might consist of strings: $0^p10^a10^q10^b10$ - *which represents transitions*

That decode to: $\delta (p,a) = (q,b,L)$

## Constructing a UTM $U$

On $M\#x$, first checks that encodings are correct. Use three tapes to store:

1. Description of $M$;
2. Contents of M’s tape;
3. $M$’s current state & position on its tape;

In each step, $U$:

- Looks at M’s current state and head position (*tape 3*)
- Reads the tape contents at the correct position (*tape 2*)
- Reads the relevant transition (*tape 1*)
- Simulates transition, updating tape, state and head position
- Accepts if $M$ accepts, rejects if $M$ rejects.

## The Halting Problem

The UTM is quite primitive – it reads (an encoding of) a TM $M$, (an encoding of) an input $x$ and simulates $M$ on $x$ – accepting, rejecting or looping depending on what $M$ does, indeed:
$$
L(U) = \{M\#x \ | \ x\in L(M)\}
$$
and the UTM will loop on $M\#x$ whenever $M$ loops on $x$ 

> In other words, can we come up with the following total TM. On $M\#x$ it:
>
> - Halts and accepts if $M$ halts on $x$ (either accepts or rejects)
> - Halts and rejects if $M$ loops on $x$

Equivalent to writing a C program that takes a *.zip* file containing some C program $X$ together with some input $x$, and returns

- 0 if X halts on x

- 1 if X gets into an infinite loop on x

This is **very** useful for compiler engineers



# Decidable and Undecidable Problems

## Properties

A property of a string is a predicate that tells you something about the string. It is either true or false. A few examples are:

The string has length 2

There is a letter ‘g’ in the string

There is an even number of letters in the string

The string contains the substring “jojo”

> A property is **semi-decidable** if all strings with that property form a language that is *recursively enumerable*
>
> It is **decidable** if all strings with that property form a language that is *recursive*

## Problems

**Decidable** - A decision problem for which there is a known algorithm for; it’s possible to solve. An example is whether a word is a palindrome or not.

**Undecidable** - A decision problem for which there is no algorithm for; it’s impossible to solve. An example is the *Halting problem*.

The following is known as the membership problem:
$$
MP \overset{def}{=} \{M\#x \ | \ x \in L(M)\}
$$
> This says can you create a TM that decides if a TM $M$ will accept an input $x$ 

We can prove $MP$ is also undecidable but this time we won't use diagonalisation (but we could)

### Proof

If $MP$ is decidable, there is a total TM $K$ for it

We can use $K$ to solve $HP$. We will construct a new TM $N$ 

$N$ on input $M\#x$:

1. Construct $M'$ that is like $M$ but with a new accept state and transitions from old accept and reject states to the new accept state. So whenever $M$ accepts or rejects, $M'$ accepts
2. Simulates $K$ on $M'\#x$, if $K$ accepts then accept, if $K$ rejects then reject

$$
M\#x \in L(N) \iff M'\#x \in L(K) \iff M \text{ halts on } x
$$

> So $N$ decides $HP$ 

We used a TM $K$ for $MP$ in order to solve $HP$ which proves that:
$$
MP \text{ decidable } \implies HP \text{ decidable}
$$
But we know that $HP​$ is undecidable, so $MP​$ is undecidable

> We have **reduced** $HP$ to $MP$ ($"HP \leq MP"$)
>
> **Intuition**: $MP$ is at least as hard as $HP$... ie By solving $MP$ we can solve $HP$ 

*We will look more at reductions in 3.4*

## Problems Concernining Turing Machines

Is it decidable whether a given $TM$

- Has at least 400 states? 

  - **Yes** - We can read an encoding of the machine, and count (e.g. using special states) whether there are at least 400 states

- Takes more than 400 steps on input $\epsilon$? 

  - **Yes** - We can simulate the running of the machine on $\epsilon$ and count the number of steps it takes, stopping after 400 steps.

- Takes more than 400 steps on some input? 

  - **Yes** - We cannot simulate for all inputs, but simulating for inputs of length up to 400 is sufficient, as in 400 steps no machine can explore more than 400 tape cells.

- Takes more than 400 steps on all inputs? 

  - **Yes** - similar to the above except now we can only accept if for all inputs we are exploring we go beyond 400 steps

- Ever moves its head more than 400 tape cells away from the left end marker on input $ϵ$?

  - **Yes** - If the machine never moves its head more than 400 tape cells away from the left end marker, then it will always move between configurations of the form $(q, y1 ...y400, h)$ with $0 ≤ h ≤ 400$. Let $N$ be the number of all possible configurations of this form. Simulating for $N + 1$ steps may give two results:
    - The machine moves beyond the first 400 tape cells. In this case accept.
    - The machine never moves beyond the first 400 tape cells. In this case it must repeat a configuration (as only N configurations are possible), and from that point it will keep repeating transitions it already made. In this case reject.



However it is **not decidable** whether a given TM:

- Accepts the null string $ϵ$
- Accepts any string at all
- Accepts every string
- Accepts a given finite language
- Accepts a given regular language
- Accepts a given context-free language
- Accepts a given recursive language

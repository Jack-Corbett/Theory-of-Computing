# Diagonalisation and the Halting Problem

We have a UTM that reads (an encoding of) a TM $M$, an (econding of) input $x$ and simulates $M$ on $x$ 
$$
L(U) = \{M\#x \ | \ x \in L(M)\}
$$
The UTM will loop on $M\#x$ if $M$ loops on $x$

## The Halting Problem

In other words can we come up with the following **total** TM $K$. On $M\#x$ it:

- Halts and accepts if $M$ halts on $x$ 
  - ie $M$ either accepts or rejects $x$
- Halts and rejects if $M$ loops on $x$ 

> We can prove this is not possible using **diagonalisation**

## Diagonalisation

Diagonalisation is a proof technique and we can use it to show, for example, that $2^\N$ in a 'larger' infinity than $\N$ 

- $2^\N$ is the set of all subsets of $\N$ 
- This means it is also the set of functions $\N \rightarrow \{0,1\}$

**Claim** there is no onto function $\varphi : \N \rightarrow 2^\N$   (*we cannot number all of the subsets of $\N$ as there are too many*) 

### Proof

Suppose $\varphi : \N \rightarrow 2^\N$ is any function whatsoever, then we can draw a table:

![Screenshot 2018-11-18 at 12.15.40](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/Diagonalisation Table 1.png)

Consider the subset of $\N$ 
$$
\psi (i) = 1 - (\varphi(i))(i)
$$
**ie** Complement the diagonal in the table. $\psi$ does not appear in the table - it differs with $\varphi (k)$ at $k$ so $\varphi$ is not onto

> This is just standard **diagonalisation**

## Halting Problem

We can use a similar argument to show that

> There does not exist a total TM $K$ that decides whether, given some TM $M$ and input $x$, $M$ halts on $x$ 

We **can** enumerate all strings over $\{0,1\}$ 

- $ϵ, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001,...$

We **can** enumerate all TMs with input alphabet $\{0,1\}$

- $M_ϵ, M_0, M_1, M_{00}, M_{01}, M_{10}, M_{11}, ...$
  - Where $M_b$ is the TM with binary encoding $b$ (or a fixed, trivial TM, if $b$ does not encode a TM)

### Undecidability

Suppose that a total TM $K$ exists that decides whether a given TM halts or not on a given input. We can construct a table:

> The left row holds all the possible turing machines and the top coloumn is all the possible inputs

We can create a new TM (record) by taking a diagonal snippet of this table

This new TM can’t fit anywhere on our original table, so the TM $K$ cannot exist. This is the diagonalisation proof. This means there is **no total turing machine** for $HP$

### Halting Problem in C

Simplify to C programs that take binary as input

> Is it possible to write a C program $Q$ that takes a C program + input and decides whether the program terminates on the input

![Screenshot 2018-11-18 at 16.16.51](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/Halting Problem in C.png)

We can write a program $R$ that on input $k$:

- Runs $Q$ on $(P_k, k)$      (we have access to $Q$'s source)
- If $Q$ says $H$, go into an infinite loop
- If $Q$ says $L$, stop

$R$ doesn't appear in the table so $Q$ does not exist!

## Big Picture

$$
HP \overset{def}{=} \{M\#x \ | \ M \text{ halts on } x\}
$$

We have therefore shown that the set $HP$ is not recursive

It is however recursively enumerable as we can construct a non **total** TM for it. 

- Because if the TM simulates $M\#x$ and it halts, the TM will accept this encoding. On all input strings that the TM accepts, the TM will accept it and not loop (because that’s the definition of an accepting string; it won’t loop).

> This means $\neg HP$ cannot be recursively enumerable as if it were then $HP$ would have to be recursive.
>

It follows that
$$
\{M\#x \ | \ M \text{ loops on } x\}
$$
Is not a recursively enumerable set

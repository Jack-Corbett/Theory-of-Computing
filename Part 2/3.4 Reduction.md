# Reduction

There are two main techinques for showing that problems are undeciable: **diagonalisation** and **reduction**

 We can:

- Perform reduction between two languages 
- Use reductions to prove (un)decidability results
- Produce reductions that prove certain problems not to be desidable (semi-decidable)

Once we have established that a problem such as $HP$ is undecidable, we can show that another problem $B$ is undecidable by **reducing** $HP$ to $B$. This means we can manipulate instances of $HP$ to make them look like instances of the problem $B$ in such a way that 'yes' instances of $HP$ becomes 'yes' instances of $B$ 

We can actually reduce $HP$ to the membership problem ($MP$)

## Properties of Languages

> $HP$ and $MP$ talk about arbitrary inputs to TM's

**Consider** can we decide, given any TM $M$ as input, whether $M$ accepts $\epsilon$?

i.e. is $A \overset{def}{=} \{ M \ | \ ϵ ∈ L(M) \}$ a recursive set?

The answer is **no** as we can reduce $HP$ to it which means that  $“HP ≤ A”$

### Proof

$$
A \overset{def}{=} \{ M \ | \ ϵ ∈ L(M) \}
$$

Suppose that $K$ is a total TM that accepts $A$ 

We construct $N$ that, on input $M\#x$:

- Constructs $M'$, that on any input $y$ it ignores its input and simulates $M$ on $x$. If $M$ accepts or rejects, then $M'$ accepts
- Simulates $K$ on $M'$, if $K$ accepts then accept, if it rejects then reject

$N$ accepts $M\#x \iff K$ accepts $M' \iff \epsilon \in L(M') \iff M$ halts on $x$ 

### MP and A

$$
MP \overset{def}{=} \{M\#x \ | \ x \in L(M) \ \} \\
A \overset{def}{=} \{M \ | \ \epsilon \in L(M)\}
$$

We have shown, through reduction from $HP$, that $MP$ and $A$ are undecidable

### Proof

- If $A$ or $MP$ was decidable, there would be a total TM for it
- We could use this TM to solve $HP$ 

## Reduction Formally

A function $f : \Sigma^* \rightarrow \Delta^* $ is **computable** when there exists a **total** TM $K$ that when started with $x \in \Sigma^*$ on its tape, eventuall halts with $f(x) \in \Delta^*$ on its tape

A **reduction** of $A \sube \Sigma^*$ to $B \sube \Delta^*$ is a computable function $f : \Sigma^* \rightarrow \Delta^*$ such that $x \in A \iff f(x) \in B$

In other words, strings in A must go to strings in B under $f$ and strings **not** in A must go to strings **not** in B under $f$

> Write $A \leq B$ if there is a reduction from $A$ to $B$ 

## Examples

> If you see $A ≤ B$, then you can convert the problem $A$ into the problem $B$

### HP $\leq$ MP

In order to reduce HP to MP we first use a reduction function to turn a halting problem into a membership problem. We can then run $K$ on $M’\#x$ to get our result.

> We also want to make reject states accept states as if they are reached the machine has halted

Let’s say we have our TM for the Halting problem $N$ and our TM for the membership problem $K$.

If we run N on $M\#x$, it should yield the same result as running K on $M’\#x$.



### HP $\leq$ State Entry Problem 

Decide whether a TM $M$ enters a given state $q$ on input $x$

![img](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/State Entry Problem.png)

Assume that we already have a TM K that decides the SEP. Create a TM $N$ which decides the HP using a reduction from the HP to the SEP.

N on inputs $M$ and $x$ (e.g. as an encoding $M\#x$):

1. Construct a new TM $M’$ from $M$

2. - Add a new state $q$
   - From all halting states add a new transition to $q$

3. Simulate $M’$, $q$, $x$ on $K$ (e.g. as an encoding $M’\#q\#x$)

4. Accept if $K$ accepts, reject if $K$ rejects

> This means if it halts it **has** to enter state $q$ which means $K$ accepts if it halts and rejects otherwise

Since we know that the HP is undecidable, the SEP must also be undecidable



### HP $\leq$ Blank Tape Halting Problem

Decide whether a TM M halts on the blank tape (no input). Decide whether a TM M halts on input $\epsilon$.

![img](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/Blank Tape Halting Problem Reduction.png)

Assume that we already have a TM $K$ that decides the BTHP. Create a TM $N$ which decides the HP using a reduction from the HP to the BTHP.

N on inputs M and x (e.g. as an encoding M#x):

1. Construct a new TM M’ from M

2. - Write x on the blank tape
   - Reset the tape head
   - Execute M with x on the tape

3. Simulate M’ on K

4. Accept if K accepts, reject if K rejects

![img](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/Blank Tape Halting Problem Function.png)

- $M’$ is a special version of $M$
- $M’$ has the same instructions as $M$, however, it has some instructions prepended to the other instructions
- These prepended instructions are from the task of writing $x$ on the tape and re-setting the tape head to the start
- So all in all we have a TM $M’$ which has the input $x$ **hard coded** in its instructions

Since we know that the HP is undecidable, the BTHP must also be undecidable

## Properties of Reductions

If $A \leq B$ and $B$ is recursively enumerable then so is $A$. Equivalenetly if $A$ is not recursivley enumberale then $B$ is not recursively enumerable

- **Proof** If $A \leq B$ then there is a computable function $f$ that takes $a \in A$ to $f(a) \in B$. If $B$ is recursively enumerable then there is a TM $M$ that accepts it. The following is a TM $N$ for $A$: on $x$, first compute $f(x)$, then run $M$ on $f(x)$, accept if it accepts, reject if it rejects

$$
x \in L(N) \iff f(x) \in L(M) \iff f(x) \in B \iff x \in A
$$

If $A \leq B$ and $B$ is recursive then so is $A$. Equivalently, if $A$ isn't recursive then neither is $B$ 

- **Proof** It’s the same proof as before, except now, the TM ‘M’ halts on all inputs.
  - If we follow through the same steps as before, our TM ‘N’ will not halt on any inputs either, because it uses ‘M’. This means that A is recursive when B is.

  - The same goes for B not being recursive if A isn’t.
  - If A is not recursive, then it’s either r.e or not r.e. We’ve already proved the case for when A is not r.e, so let’s prove the case for when A is r.e.
  - Let’s say that B is recursive and has a TM ‘M’ that halts on all inputs.
  - If we have ‘M’, we can create a recursive TM ‘N’ that halts on all inputs and determines A.
  - Therefore, B cannot be recursive if A is not recursive.

# Class P

Contains all feasible decision problems, ie the set of all decision problems that can be solved in **polynomial time** by a **deterministic** turing machine.

> It is invariant for all models of computation or programming languages - so we don't have to give a turing machine we can just give an algorithm provided the model used is turing complete

Every regular language is in P 

Examples:

- Searching an unordered list
- Searching an ordered list
- Testing whether a list is sorted...

## PATH Exercise

Let PATH be the following decision problem: Given a directed graph, does there exist a directed path connecting two given nodes? Is PATH in P?

### Brute Force Approach

On input $(G, s, t)$:

- Examine all potential paths in G (sequences of nodes of length at most the number of nodes in G),
- Accept if there exists a path from s to t, otherwise reject. 

The above algorithm needs to examine roughly $n^n$ paths, with $n$ the number of nodes!

### Polynomial Time Approach

On input $(G, s, t)$:

- Place a mark on node $s$
- Repeat until no additional nodes are marked:
  - For each edge $(a, b)$ of $G$, if $a$ is marked then mark $b$
- If $t$ is marked then accept, otherwise reject

> This runs in polynomial time:
>
> - At most $n$ stages
> - At each stage need to go through $m$ edges, for each edge $(a,b)$ at most $n$ operations to check if $a$ is marked
> - A further $n$ (at most) operations at the end, to check if $t$ is marked for $n$ noes and $m$ edges

## Deciding Context Free Languages

Every **context free language** is also in P 

- Let G be a grammar for $L /\ \{\epsilon\}$ in Chomsky normal form, with $S$ as the start symbol;
- To decide if G can generate a (non-empty) string $w = w_1 . . . w_n$, compute for each sub-string $w_i . . . w_j$ of $w$, the set table(i, j) of non-terminals which can generate the sub-string â€“ this parsing can be done in polynomial time using CYK
- If S can generate $w_1 . . . w_n$ then accept, otherwise reject.

Every **regular language** is also in P

- A Turing machine can simulate a DFA



# Class NP

The set of all decision problems that can be solved by a **non-deterministic** Turing machine in **polynomial time**

## Non-Deterministic Turing Machines

A non-deterministic machine can be thought of as making **all** possible transitions from a given configuration in parallel.

It accepts an input if **some** branch of the computation leads to the accept state

It rejects an input if **all** branches of the computation lead to the reject state.

> It's called decidable (a decider) if all branches halt on all inputs, meaning it must either accept or reject for all branches

For any non-deterministic TM there exists a deterministic TM which accepts the same language.

**Proof** we can simulate a non deterministic TM $N$ using a multi-tape TM which tries **all branches** of $N$'s computation (breadth-first).

- One tape stores the input
- One tape is used to simulate a branch up to a given depth
- One tape is used to remember the branch being simulated

If it finds the accept state on one of the branches, accept. Otherwise it will loop.

> We can modify the proof above so that if $N$ halts on all branches then $D$ halts, to do this:
>
> - Remember the branches that halt (*e.g.* on a fourth tape) and do not explore them again
> - If no branch left to explore, reject.
>
> This means **any** non-deterministic TM has an equivalent **deterministic** TM (this also means a language is recursive if and only if some non-deterministic TM decides it)

### Formally

A non deterministic Turing Machine has the transition function:
$$
\delta : (Q - \{t,r\}) \times \Gamma \rightarrow P(Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\})
$$


## Time Complexity of TMs

We take:

- The **size of a problem instance** to be the number of symbols on the input tape
- The **algorithm cost** (measure of time taken) to be the number of Turing machine steps executed.

The **running time** or time complexity of a decider is the function $f : \N \rightarrow \N$ where $f(n)$ is the maximum number of steps the machine uses on *any branch of its computation*, on any input of length **n**

### Comparing Computational Models

Let $t(n)$ be a function, where $t(n) \geq n$

1. Every $t(n)$ time multi-tape (deterministic) Turing machine has an equivalent $O(t^2(n))$ time single-tape (deterministic) Turing machine
2. Every $t(n)$ time non-deterministic Turing machine has an equivalent $2^{O(t(n))}$ time deterministic Turing machine

> $f(n)$ is $2^{O(t(n))}$ means $f(n) \leq 2^{c \ t(n)}$ for some constant $c > 0$ and all $n \geq N$ with $N$ fixed

## NP Examples

Anything in **P** is in **NP**. If a problem can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic machine, then also by a non-deterministic one.

### Boolean Satisfiability - SAT

> Given a boolean expression does there exist an assignment of 0s and 1s to the variables such that the formula is satisfied?
>

![Screenshot 2018-12-17 at 15.26.57](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/SAT.png)

It is in **NP** as we can non-deterministically generate all possible assignments to the variables, then substitute each of them in the formula to see if it is satisfied.

This can be done in non-deterministic polynomial (linear) time. We don't know if it is in P as we currently don't have a polynomial time algorithm for it.

### Hamiltonian Path - HAMPATH

> Given a directed graph, does there exist a directed path conneting two given nodes that goes through each node exactly once?
>

It in in **NP** as we can non-deterministically generate all sequences of nodes of length equal to the size of the graph $n$, and then check for any such sequence that:

- No repetitions are found in the sequence
- The start and end of the sequence coincide with the required nodes
- The sequence defines a directed path through the graph

### Travelling Salesperson Problem - TSP

> Given a number $D$ and $n$ cities $c_1,...,c_n$ with lists of distances between them: $d(c_i,c_j) = d_{i,j}$ is there a route leading round all the cities and back to the start, with total distance at most $D$?

![Screenshot 2018-12-17 at 15.41.45](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/TSP.png)

The non-deterministic machine can just **guess** an order in which to visit the cities, and then add up the distances to see if they are at most $D$. 

### 3COL

> Given a graph G, is it possible to colour the vertices with at most 3 colours such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour

![Screenshot 2018-12-17 at 15.44.33](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/3COL.png)

We can **guess** the colour of each vertex and check that the resulting colouring is valid

## Equivalent Definition (Book)

> NP is the set of all decision problems for which a solution can be checked (by a deterministic TM) in polynomial time

More formally we can say:

- The input to the deterministic machine consists of a problem instance and a **certificate** or **proof** that the given instance is a *yes* instance
- The size of the certificate can be no more than polynomial in the size of the problem instance, if the certificate can be checked in polynomial time

## Not in NP

Consider the simple theory of addition on natural numbers, where statements are closed formulas of a first order predicate calculus that uses just 0, 1, + and = (in addition to boolean operators and quantifiers).

![Screenshot 2018-12-17 at 15.51.48](/Users/jackcorbett/Documents/University/Theory of Computing/Part 2/Images/Presburger Arithmetic.png)

The problem **is** decidable but is **not** in NP

## P = NP?

The best known algorithms for SAT, TSP(D), 3COL are exponential but nobody has been able to prove that the only algorithms for these problems are exponential. So P could be equal to NP but we expect there are problems that are in NP that can't be in P... We just haven't proved it.
